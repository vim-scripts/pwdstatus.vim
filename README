I'm often using :cd or autochdir and can never remember where I currently am.  Why use :pwd when that information can already be on the statusline?

I also glance at the filename, line number, column number, etc..  Some information I look for more often than others.  Those things should stand out but just a little.  This statusline uses color to draw your attention ever so slightly.  That is, unless it's read-only, unsaved, etc., which should *really* draw your attention!
